6. Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given 
formula:
Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H]
Following are the fixed values of C and H:
C is 50. H is 30.
D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a commaseparated sequence.For example Let us assume the following comma 
separated input sequence is given to the program:
100,150,180
INPUT:-
import math
numbers=input("provide D:")
numbers= numbers.split(',')
result_list=[]
for D in numbers:
    Q=round(math.sqrt(2*50*int(D)/30))
    result_list.append(Q)
    print(result_list)

OUTPUT:-
provide D:100,150,180
[18]
[18, 22]
[18, 22, 24]
